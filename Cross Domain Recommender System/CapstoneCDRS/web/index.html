                    <h1>About CDRS</h1>
                    <p>Recommender system has the ability to predict whether a particular user would prefer an item 
                        or not based on the user's profile and hence are beneficial to both service providers and users.
                        Cross domain recommender systems can assist recommendations to a user in target domain based on 
                        knowledge learned from the items in source domain.
                    <br/>                 
                        With the rapid growth of the Web in terms of users and items, 
                        majority of the Recommender Systems using Collaborative Filtering technique
                        suffers from the scalability problem because similarities between every pair of users 
                        and/or items need to be computed during the training phase. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to address this scalability issue,
                       we partition the entire users’ space into smaller regions based on the attribute, and then apply the 
                        Recommendation Algorithm separately to these regions. This helps us to avoid computations
                        over the entire data. One of the main objectives of our work is to reduce the running time
                        without compromising the recommendation quality much. This ensures scalability, allowing us
                        to tackle bigger datasets using the same resources.

                        It helps in making the following things:

                    <ol>
                       <li>1) Increased Speed – Time Efficiency of recommendations.</li>
                        <li>2) Due to the notion of making independent disjoint sets – Parallel Processing of recommendations.</li>
                        <li>3) Improved the quality of recommendations which are highly accurate through – Natural Language Processing.  </li>
